# Crypto

## Solved challenges:

- CRYMEPLX (real mode aka *level 1*)
- FLAGPEDIA (big real mode aka *level 2*)
- KRÃœPTO (big real mode)

## Reflections:

The solved problems are quite manageable with some research and crypto is the more beginner-friendly category in this CTF. Not much coding or abstract algebra is needed.

I liked the idea of CMS (long mode aka *level 5*) but I totally failed to think systematically on that one and resorted to brute-forcing $k^n\*adminusername$ being in `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,200}$`. [This writeup by Louis Bettens](https://louis.bettens.info/blog/posts/cybersecurityrumble-2022-cms-writeup/) is eye-opening. Again it only requires insights and not much coding nor advanced mathematics, luvin' it.
