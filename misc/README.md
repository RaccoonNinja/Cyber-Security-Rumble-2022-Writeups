# Misc

## Solved challenges:

- MiscMePlx

## Reflections:

- There are only 4 misc challenges: one basic research, one programming, one with crypto and pwn aspects, one pikachu.
- I felt that I would get the flag eventually if I worked long enough for PikachuFace, but I worked in such a disorganized way that it became a serious blunder. Anyway I absolutely hate pikachu now (j/k).
