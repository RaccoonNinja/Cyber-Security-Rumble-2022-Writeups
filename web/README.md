# Web

## Solved challenges:

- RobertIsAGangsta (huge real mode aka *level 3*)

## Reflections:

- I really didn't look into web challenges that much, being intimidated by V1rusCheck0r3000 in level 2.
- I don't feel RobertIsAGangsta belong to the third tier as well - it is on par with V1rusCheck0r3000 but without the red-herrings.
- Instead of spending time on pikachu, I should have at least explored more on AESAAS, which is similar to SekaiCTF's [Bottle Poem](https://github.com/RaccoonNinja/Project-SEKAI-CTF-2022-Writeups/blob/main/web/Bottle%20Poem.md) but easier.
