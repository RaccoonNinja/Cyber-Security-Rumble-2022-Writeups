# Cyber Security Rumble 2022 Writeups

Original write-ups by RaccoonNinja on [Cyber Security Rumble 2022](https://ctf.cybersecurityrumble.de/scoreboard/).

First of all thank RedRocket for hosting this CTF. The challenges are hard but also very inspiring. There were fewer categories (web, pwn, crypto, reverse, misc) than other CTFs I've played this year so I got some focus.

## Reflections

- While I'm satisfied with my ranking\* - I feel like I wasn't doing good enough and got to that place merely by working on the problems for 20 out of 24 hours
- While grouping challenges by difficulty is understandable as some problems are multi-categorical, this is the first time I met that and I was more demotivated from solving "harder" problems than before, while getting stuck on "easier" problems
- I spent way much time chasing rabbit holes for some "easier" problems (V1RUSCHECK0R3000) and could have worked more systematically for others (PIKACHUFACE, CMS)
- I could be tired as this is my 3rd consecutive weekend CTF solo (DownUnderCTF, SekaiCTF) ~better sleep more~

\*: From this CTF I noticed how ranking is not very meaningful, in particular that around 70% of the teams got 0 (the challenges are hard). Score or solves are better metrics.

## Declaration

- All tools deployed were solely for learning cybersecurity.
- The tools were not used against any machine other than those provided by the organizer.
- Skills covered here are not to be used in any illegal activity and I do not endorse any illegal activity.
